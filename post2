<p>Undercounting of total cases and death figures was reported during the first wave in 2020. The discrepancies were detected by comparing official death counts released by the governments to the number of deaths reported in obituaries, at crematoria and burial grounds, etc. Some states were reported to have not added suspected cases to the final count contrary to WHO guidelines.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India#cite_note-527">[520]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India#cite_note-528">[521]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India#cite_note-529">[522]</a></sup>&nbsp;Similar undercounting was reported during the second wave in 2021.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India#cite_note-530">[523]</a></sup>&nbsp;There have been large gaps noted between official death figures and the sudden increase in the number of bodies being cremated and buried.

<p>A series of articles in&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hindu">The Hindu</a></em>&nbsp;newspaper in 2021 estimated that compared to previous years, the number of additional deaths during the pandemic (known as the 'excess mortality') was about four times the official COVID death toll in Chennai, Kolkata and Mumbai, and could be up to ten times higher in the state of Gujarat. However, it is not clear what proportion of these are due to COVID and what are due to other factors such as overcrowding of medical facilities, lock-down, etc.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India#cite_note-533">[526]</a></sup>&nbsp;A report by the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Global_Development">Center for Global Development</a>&nbsp;stated that the second wave of COVID-19 in India was the "worst tragedy since the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India">partition</a>". The report, based on serosurveys, household data and official data, pointed towards a significant underreporting of deaths, with estimates ranging from about 1 million to 6 million deaths overall, with central estimates varying between 3.4 and 4.9 million deaths.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India#cite_note-534">[527]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India#cite_note-535">[528]</a></sup></p>

<p>On the evening of 11 April, two reporters from the Gujarati language newspaper&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandesh_(Indian_newspaper)"><em>Sandesh</em></a>&nbsp;and a photojournalist staked out the mortuary of the 1,200-bed state-run COVID-19 hospital in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad">Ahmedabad</a>. Over 17 hours, they counted 69 body bags coming out of a single exit before they were loaded into waiting ambulances. Next day, Gujarat officially counted 55 deaths, including 20 from Ahmedabad. Again on the night of 16 April, these journalists visited 21 cremation grounds around Ahmedabad and counted more than 200 bodies, with photographic and video evidence. The next day Ahmedabad counted only 25 deaths. Similar disparities in numbers were seen on other days.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India#cite_note-536">[529]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India#cite_note-537">[530]</a></sup>&nbsp;The Gujarat government denied the under-counting and stated that they were following federal protocols.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India#cite_note-538">[531]</a></sup></p>

The study used data from civil death registers in a subset of Gujarat's 162 municipalities. The authors stated that the "vast majority" of these deaths could likely be attributed directly to COVID-19. The government's estimate of the death toll from COVID-19 for the entire state was approximately 10,000 for the same period.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India#cite_note-539">[532]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India#cite_note-540">[533]</a></sup></p>

<p>Undercounting of total cases and death figures was reported during the first wave in 2020.

<p>A series of articles in&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hindu">The Hindu</a></em>&nbsp;newspaper in 2021 estimated that compared to previous years, the number of additional deaths during the pandemic (known as the 'excess mortality') was about four times the official COVID death toll in Chennai, Kolkata and Mumbai, and could be up to ten times higher in the state of Gujarat. However, it is not clear what proportion of these are due to COVID and what are due to other factors such as overcrowding of medical facilities, lock-down, etc.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India#cite_note-533">[526]</a></sup>&nbsp;A report by the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Global_Development">Center for Global Development</a>&nbsp;stated that the second wave of COVID-19 in India was the "worst tragedy since the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India">partition</a>".

<p>On the evening of 11 April, two reporters from the Gujarati language newspaper&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandesh_(Indian_newspaper)"><em>Sandesh</em></a>&nbsp;and a photojournalist staked out the mortuary of the 1,200-bed state-run COVID-19 hospital in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad">Ahmedabad</a>. Over 17 hours, they counted 69 body bags coming out of a single exit before they were loaded into waiting ambulances. Next day, Gujarat officially counted 55 deaths, including 20 from Ahmedabad. Again on the night of 16 April, these journalists visited 21 cremation grounds around Ahmedabad and counted more than 200 bodies, with photographic and video evidence. The next day Ahmedabad counted only 25 deaths.

The study used data from civil death registers in a subset of Gujarat's 162 municipalities. The authors stated that the "vast majority" of these deaths could likely be attributed directly to COVID-19.

<p>Undercounting of total cases and death figures was reported during the first wave in 2020. The discrepancies were detected by comparing official death counts released by the governments to the number of deaths reported in obituaries, at crematoria and burial grounds, etc. Some states were reported to have not added suspected cases to the final count contrary to WHO guidelines.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India#cite_note-527">[520]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India#cite_note-528">[521]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India#cite_note-529">[522]</a></sup>&nbsp;Similar undercounting was reported during the second wave in 2021.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India#cite_note-530">[523]</a></sup>&nbsp;There have been large gaps noted between official death figures and the sudden increase in the number of bodies being cremated and buried.

<p>A series of articles in&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hindu">The Hindu</a></em>&nbsp;newspaper in 2021 estimated that compared to previous years, the number of additional deaths during the pandemic (known as the 'excess mortality') was about four times the official COVID death toll in Chennai, Kolkata and Mumbai, and could be up to ten times higher in the state of Gujarat. However, it is not clear what proportion of these are due to COVID and what are due to other factors such as overcrowding of medical facilities, lock-down, etc.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India#cite_note-533">[526]</a></sup>&nbsp;A report by the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Global_Development">Center for Global Development</a>&nbsp;stated that the second wave of COVID-19 in India was the "worst tragedy since the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India">partition</a>". The report, based on serosurveys, household data and official data, pointed towards a significant underreporting of deaths, with estimates ranging from about 1 million to 6 million deaths overall, with central estimates varying between 3.4 and 4.9 million deaths.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India#cite_note-534">[527]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India#cite_note-535">[528]</a></sup></p>

<p>On the evening of 11 April, two reporters from the Gujarati language newspaper&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandesh_(Indian_newspaper)"><em>Sandesh</em></a>&nbsp;and a photojournalist staked out the mortuary of the 1,200-bed state-run COVID-19 hospital in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad">Ahmedabad</a>. Over 17 hours, they counted 69 body bags coming out of a single exit before they were loaded into waiting ambulances. Next day, Gujarat officially counted 55 deaths, including 20 from Ahmedabad. Again on the night of 16 April, these journalists visited 21 cremation grounds around Ahmedabad and counted more than 200 bodies, with photographic and video evidence. The next day Ahmedabad counted only 25 deaths. Similar disparities in numbers were seen on other days.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India#cite_note-536">[529]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India#cite_note-537">[530]</a></sup>&nbsp;The Gujarat government denied the under-counting and stated that they were following federal protocols.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India#cite_note-538">[531]</a></sup></p>

The study used data from civil death registers in a subset of Gujarat's 162 municipalities. The authors stated that the "vast majority" of these deaths could likely be attributed directly to COVID-19. The government's estimate of the death toll from COVID-19 for the entire state was approximately 10,000 for the same period.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India#cite_note-539">[532]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India#cite_note-540">[533]</a></sup></p>

The report "accounts for deaths averted during the pandemic, for example because of the lower risk of traffic accidents during lockdowns." WHO said it was yet to fully examine new data provided by India and it may add a disclaimer due to ongoing conversation with India</p>
